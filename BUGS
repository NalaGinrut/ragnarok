* guile CGI tpl access will cause crash after many refreshing

* POST method: redirect conn-socket to current-input-port and read ,will cause crash
  because it countered <eof>.

* Version number delayed each commit. Because version info is relative to git info.
  We should make sure that the user run ./autogen.sh each time they compile. 
  Can we make it automatically to avoid handling it by users?

* This should throw an *Internal Error* but it causes client halt:
  <%= not-a-bounded-symbol %>
