Ragnarok
========

Ragnarok is a generic server written with GNU Guile. 
The notable features listed here:
*  Unified epoll/select/kqueue interface
*  Concurrency based on threads
*  High performance concurrency with delimited-continuation based Actors-model (work in progress)
*  Object oriented 
   (yes, I'm the minority in Guile community who try to program with GOOPS, though FP features may cancel out most of OO features)
*  HTTP/1.1
*  Multi-protocols
*  Multi-languages
   (Guile is actually a dynamic compiler collection against the GCC who's the static one according to Andy's free speech. So multi-language must be the most fascinating feature.)
*  Guile/Scheme Template
*  Configurable
*  MIME
*  Logger
*  Standard CGI
*  Fast CGI (not sure whether worthy adding it since Guile has multi-language feature)
*  Static page and binary downloading service (of course)
