  - (reload-module (resolve-module '(ragnarok server))) 
  - (reload-extensions server)

    1. env:mime-types-list;
    2. env:handler-list;
    3. the specified server's attributes;
    4. other servers won't change their behavior, but if they restart, new env works.

* Acctual logger operation should delay to the end of page handler. 
  That means client should get response as soon as possible. 

* Filter the target path, it should not appear '\n'

* Use catch/throw to handle the error
