* Restart server on the fly with some special command.
  - (reload-module (resolve-module '(ragnarok server))) 
  - (reload-extensions server)
    This step will refresh:
    1. env:mime-types-list;
    2. env:handler-list;
    3. the specified server's attributes;
    4. other servers won't change their behavior, but if they restart, new env works.
